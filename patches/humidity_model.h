/* Estimate of the moisture the humidifier chamber adds.
 *
 * The stock humidifier is open loop: it sets the heater duty from the moisture
 * the air needs, duty = k0 + k1 * flow * dAH (+ k2 * (plate - ambient)), with
 * flow in L/min and dAH in g/m3, capped at 0.85 and limited near a 63-68 degC
 * plate. k3 + k4 * duty is only a low-plate threshold for full power. The
 * duty says what the water would evaporate once warm; while the water heats
 * it evaporates less, which is the dry start.
 *
 * Two upper bounds are therefore combined:
 * - plate: the chamber adds at most the saturation humidity gained between
 *   ambient and ambient + coupling * (plate - ambient), so water no warmer
 *   than the room adds nothing;
 * - power: the measured heater duty, through the stock calibration, can add
 *   at most (duty - k0) / (k1 * flow) g/m3.
 * The smaller one holds during warm-up (plate) and at steady state (power).
 * Flow is the average blower flow (AFL), not the instantaneous flow, which
 * swings with every breath. Stock only runs its model at 8 L/min or more;
 * below that, or without usable calibration, only the plate bound applies.
